## Build/Test Commands
<!-- Add commands as project develops -->
<!-- Example: npm test -- path/to/test.ts (single test) -->

## Architecture
This is a new project. Document structure here as it develops.

## Code Style
- Use consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint recommended)
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use descriptive variable/function names
- Handle errors explicitly, avoid silent failures
- Group imports: external deps, then internal modules

## Conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests alongside new features
- Document public APIs
